	Inspiration on the way home from work - use a "# line " directive to
	force the line numbers in the files, rather than messy $SIG{__WARN__}
	and $SIG{__DIE__} handlers to launder the error messages later.
	About an hour and a bit later, having discovered that coderef INC
	filters (if not all filters - check this carefully) can't return
	multiple lines in the same string, finally get the bugger working.
	Also add a test to check that we can actually load the modules without
	warnings or errors before using Acme::use::strict::with::pride
	Break the tiehandle out into a new package GagMe;
	(Well, it seemed to be an accurate description of what it is doing to
	 STDERR)
