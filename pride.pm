=head1 NAME

Acme::use::strict::with::pride - enforce bondage and discipline on very
naughty modules.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Acme::use::strict::with::pride;
  # now all your naughty modules get to use strict; and use warnings;

=head1 ABSTRACT

using Acme::use::strict::with::pride causes all modules to run with
C<use strict;> and C<use warnings;>

B<Whether they like it or not> :-)

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Acme::use::strict::with::pride installs a code reference into C<@INC> that
intercepts all future C<use> and C<require> requests.  (code references in
C<@INC> were in 5.6.x, but were not documented until 5.8.0, which extends the
feature to allow objects in C<@INC>).

The subroutine in C<@INC> then finds the module using the normal C<@INC> path,
opens the file, and attaches a source filter that adds
"use strict; use warnings;" to the start of every file. This is naughty - it's
not a documented feature, it may be changed or removed with no notice, and the
current implementation is slightly buggy in subtle cases.

=head2 EXPORT

Nothing. There's no unimport method, so using strict with pride is a one way
trip. This could be construed as a bug or a feature, depending on your point
of view.

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<strict> L<warnings> L<Acme::USIG>

=head1 BUGS

There's no unimport. There's no way to specify an import list to
C<use strict;> or C<use warnings;>. There's no way to exclude specific
modules (eg C<Exporter>) from the clutches C<Acme::use::strict:with::pride>.
The error and warning handling is global, rather than being chained, and it
won't play nicely with error objects. The source filter in coderef C<@INC> is
undocumented, so I shouldn't be using it.
